# STAR

Stock Assessment Results (STAR) is a new framework to organize
[GFCM](http://www.fao.org/gfcm/en/) stock assessment results.

It streamlines and automates the **information flow** from stock assessments to
scientific advice, strengthens **quality assurance** and **data dissemination**.

The central part of the framework will be the STAR database, scheduled to launch
in 2021. It will serve as a foundation to provide a variety of
quality-controlled data products related to the management of fisheries in the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
